# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_app.py
```

## Coding Standards

### Python Code Style
- Follow **PEP 8** guidelines
- Use **Black** for code formatting: `black .`
- Use **flake8** for linting: `flake8 .`
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black default)

### Code Quality Guidelines

#### General Principles
- Write clear, readable code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle

#### Python Specific
```python
# Good
def calculate_predicted_price(features: list) -> float:
    """Calculate predicted laptop price based on features.
    
    Args:
        features: List of laptop specifications
        
    Returns:
        Predicted price in euros
    """
    # Load model and make prediction
    model = load_model()
    return model.predict([features])[0]

# Avoid
def calc(f):
    m = pickle.load(open('model.pkl', 'rb'))
    return m.predict([f])[0]
```

#### HTML/CSS
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Follow accessibility best practices
- Use CSS classes instead of IDs for styling
- Keep CSS organized and commented

#### JavaScript
- Use modern ES6+ syntax
- Add JSDoc comments for functions
- Handle errors gracefully
- Follow async/await patterns

### Testing
- Write tests for new features
- Maintain existing test coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Test edge cases and error conditions

```python
def test_price_prediction_valid_input():
    """Test price prediction with valid laptop specifications."""
    features = [8, 1.5, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, ...]  # Valid features
    result = prediction(features)
    assert isinstance(result, np.ndarray)
    assert result[0] > 0
```
